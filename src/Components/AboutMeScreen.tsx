            Hi, my name is Cory Grewohl and I'm currently a senior computer
            science major at California Baptist University. At the end of my
            junior year I felt I had learned a lot, but I wanted to pick one
            area to really dive into. I loved creating Guavah in{" "}
            <Image src={ReactPic} maxH="22px" w="auto" display="inline" />
            React Native for my junior capstone class, so I decided to focus on
            web development to learn{" "}
            <Image src={ReactPic} maxH="22px" w="auto" display="inline" />
            React, but first I knew I had to go back to the basics.
            <br />
            <br />
            So, starting in May 2022, I started learning everything I could
            about <Image src={HTMLPic} maxH="22px" w="auto" display="inline" />
            HTML, <Image src={CSSPic} maxH="22px" w="auto" display="inline" />
            CSS, and <Image src={JSPic} maxH="22px" w="auto" display="inline" />
            Javascript by making as many projects I could. And for the last few
            months I have dove into the{" "}
            <Image src={ReactPic} maxH="22px" w="auto" display="inline" />
            React ecosystem, trying to learn as much about{" "}
            <Image src={ReactPic} maxH="22px" w="auto" display="inline" />
            React as I can, and learn the important related technologies like{" "}
            <Image src={TSPic} maxH="22px" w="auto" display="inline" />
            Typescript,{" "}
            <Image src={ReduxPic} maxH="22px" w="auto" display="inline" />
            Redux,{" "}
            <Image src={StyledCompnentsPic} maxH="22px" w="auto" display="inline" />
            Styled-Components, and more by creating multiple projects.
            <br />
            <br />
            In my free time I like to skateboard, hang out with friends, eat,
            and play guitar. I also love Lego, cats, and movies. I honestly
            really do enjoy front end development and I'm eager to learn more,
            including learning backend technologies.
